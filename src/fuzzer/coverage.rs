pub struct CoverageEngine {}

/// The objective of this `struct` is to assist Phink in instrumenting ink! smart contracts.
/// In a fuzzing context, instrumenting a smart contract involves modifying the target (i.e., the WASM blob),
/// for example, by adding additional code to branches to obtain a coverage map during the execution of the smart contract.
/// By doing so, we can effectively generate a coverage map that will be provided to Ziggy
/// or LibAFL, transforming Phink from a basic brute-forcing tool into a powerful coverage-guided fuzzer.
